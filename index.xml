      <description>Many more in-depth reviews are available at GoodReads, so I wont belabor this much.
The writing style is so easy-going the subject matter is interesting and almost fun. Silvanus makes a difficult learning curve much more approachable by bringing abstract concepts down to earth, often with simple illustrations.
The first publication date is 1910, so there are free PDF versions available. Or if you like the navigability of the Kindle version, its $3 in the store.</description>

      <description>Microcontrollers The Adafruit Feather family of microcontrollers is compact and with loads of useful expansion options. The latest and greatest as of now is the &amp;ldquo;Feather M4 Express&amp;rdquo; powered by the 120MHz ATSAMD51J19. This board ships with CircuitPython, Adafruits simplified distribution of Micropython, and 2MB of flash for library, script, and data storage. Priced under $25, its a no brainer for anyone and everyone wanting to break into hobby electronics of just about any flavor.</description>
