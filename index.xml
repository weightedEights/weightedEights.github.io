      <description>About This Project Depending on how many events are aggregated here, this page could get big. At that point I&amp;rsquo;ll have to make the title collapsible or something. For the time being it will be a scroll-fest.
North America Anything North of the Panama Canal.
1874 Huge Locust Swarm Described in detail at Historynet.com. The geographic scale of the swarm is summarized partway through:
&amp;ldquo;A map produced by the state of Missouri shows that the 1874 infestation spread from the eastern slope of the Rockies into western Iowa, Minnesota and Missouri and from the Canadian Prairie provinces to central Texas, just north of Austin.</description>

      <description>Scrub The Air Back in the &amp;rsquo;80s NASA conducted studies on plants suitable for &amp;ldquo;Indoor Air Pollution Abatement&amp;rdquo;. The Sansevieria family of plants were excellent performers and have the added benefit of being hardy succulents, requiring little water and indirect sunlight. A living plant is calming in my work space and the added air quality benefit makes this an easy choice for the amount of space it takes.
The Plant The sansevieria fernwood variety happens to be $7 at Ikea.</description>

      <description>Anytone AT-D878UV A work horse dual-band handheld with enough analog and digital functionality to carry even advanced users for years and years.
Beginner Kit This kit is the one I purchased which includes a charging cradle, a programming cable, and access to the BridgeCom tutorial videos. I also purchased an extra battery and a lighter adapter charge cable. The price felt steep when I placed the order, but after a week of building a code plug and now a month of use, I am more than satisfied with my purchase.</description>

      <title>Create A New Git Repo To Track Existing Files And Directories</title>
      <link>https://weightedeights.github.io/posts/new_git_repo_with_existing_files/</link>

      <description>Preamble If you have existing files which you want to begin tracking in a git repository, there a few non-obvious hoops to jump through. This process assumes the repo will be created on Github, but should be easy to follow if that is not the case.
Git Particulars, Initializing Creating a new repo on Github is very straightforward. I recommend adding a license and a readme.md both for their utility and so the repo is non-empty.</description>

      <description>Baofeng UV-5R A cheap beginner dual-band handheld with enough features to be useful. Lots of extensive reviews exist, so Ill just touch on my limited use case.
This kit is the one I started with which includes a spare battery, whip antenna, programming cable, and &amp;ldquo;other stuff&amp;rdquo;. Good value for what is included.
Antennas and Accessories The stock UV-5R antenna is useable, but many options exist to support specific use cases.</description>

      <description>Preamble This site is a work in progress, a project as such. It has been enough of an effort for me that documenting the details is worthwhile for me, maybe for someone else too.
A statically-generated site allows all of your content to be created and maintained locally and allows you to control display elements with finer granularity.
All of my work and personal computing is and has been on Windows OS machines, for various reasons.</description>

      <title>Calculus Made Easy - A Review</title>
      <link>https://weightedeights.github.io/posts/calc_made_easy_review/</link>

      <description>Many more in-depth reviews are available at GoodReads, so I wont belabor this much.
The writing style is so easy-going the subject matter is interesting and almost fun. Silvanus makes a difficult learning curve much more approachable by bringing abstract concepts down to earth, often with simple illustrations.
The first publication date is 1910, so there are free PDF versions available. Or if you like the navigability of the Kindle version, its $3 in the store.</description>

      <description>Microcontrollers The Adafruit Feather family of microcontrollers is compact and with loads of useful expansion options. The latest and greatest as of now is the &amp;ldquo;Feather M4 Express&amp;rdquo; powered by the 120MHz ATSAMD51J19. This board ships with CircuitPython, Adafruit&amp;rsquo;s simplified distribution of Micropython, and 2MB of flash for library, script, and data storage. Priced under $25, its a no brainer for anyone and everyone wanting to break into hobby electronics of just about any flavor.</description>
