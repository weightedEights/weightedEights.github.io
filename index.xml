      <description>Baofeng UV-5R A cheap beginner dual-band handheld with enough features to be useful. Lots of extensive reviews exist, so Ill just touch on my limited use case.
This kit is the one I started with which includes a spare battery, whip antenna, programming cable, and &amp;ldquo;other stuff&amp;rdquo;. Good value for what is included.
Antennas and Accessories The stock UV-5R antenna is useable, but many options exist to support specific use cases.</description>

      <description>Preamble This site is a work in progress, a project as such. It has been enough of an effort for me that documenting the details is worthwhile for me, maybe for someone else too.
A statically-generated site allows all of your content to be created and maintained locally and allows you to control display elements with finer granularity.
All of my work and personal computing is and has been on Windows OS machines, for various reasons.</description>

      <title>Calculus Made Easy - A Review</title>

      <description>Many more in-depth reviews are available at GoodReads, so I wont belabor this much.
The writing style is so easy-going the subject matter is interesting and almost fun. Silvanus makes a difficult learning curve much more approachable by bringing abstract concepts down to earth, often with simple illustrations.
The first publication date is 1910, so there are free PDF versions available. Or if you like the navigability of the Kindle version, its $3 in the store.</description>

      <description>Microcontrollers The Adafruit Feather family of microcontrollers is compact and with loads of useful expansion options. The latest and greatest as of now is the &amp;ldquo;Feather M4 Express&amp;rdquo; powered by the 120MHz ATSAMD51J19. This board ships with CircuitPython, Adafruit&amp;rsquo;s simplified distribution of Micropython, and 2MB of flash for library, script, and data storage. Priced under $25, its a no brainer for anyone and everyone wanting to break into hobby electronics of just about any flavor.</description>
