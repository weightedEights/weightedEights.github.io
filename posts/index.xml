      <description>Many more in-depth reviews are available at GoodReads, so I wont belabor this much.
The writing style is so easy-going the subject matter is interesting and almost fun. Silvanus makes a difficult learning curve much more approachable by bringing abstract concepts down to earth, often with simple illustrations.
The first publication date is 1910, so there are free PDF versions available. Or if you like the navigability of the Kindle version, its $3 in the store.</description>
