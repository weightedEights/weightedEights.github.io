      <description>Preamble This site is a work in progress, a project as such. It has been enough of an effort for me that documenting the details is worthwhile for me, maybe for someone else too.
A statically-generated site allows all of your content to be created and maintained locally and allows you to control display elements with finer granularity.
All of my work and personal computing is and has been on Windows OS machines, for various reasons.</description>

      <description>Microcontrollers The Adafruit Feather family of microcontrollers is compact and with loads of useful expansion options. The latest and greatest as of now is the &amp;ldquo;Feather M4 Express&amp;rdquo; powered by the 120MHz ATSAMD51J19. This board ships with CircuitPython, Adafruit&amp;rsquo;s simplified distribution of Micropython, and 2MB of flash for library, script, and data storage. Priced under $25, its a no brainer for anyone and everyone wanting to break into hobby electronics of just about any flavor.</description>
