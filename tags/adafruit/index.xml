      <description>Scrub The Air Back in the &amp;rsquo;80s NASA conducted studies on plants suitable for &amp;ldquo;Indoor Air Pollution Abatement&amp;rdquo;. The Sansevieria family of plants were excellent performers and have the added benefit of being hardy succulents, requiring little water and indirect sunlight. A living plant is calming in my work space and the added air quality benefit makes this an easy choice for the amount of space it takes.
The Plant The sansevieria fernwood variety happens to be $7 at Ikea.</description>

      <description>Microcontrollers The Adafruit Feather family of microcontrollers is compact and with loads of useful expansion options. The latest and greatest as of now is the &amp;ldquo;Feather M4 Express&amp;rdquo; powered by the 120MHz ATSAMD51J19. This board ships with CircuitPython, Adafruit&amp;rsquo;s simplified distribution of Micropython, and 2MB of flash for library, script, and data storage. Priced under $25, its a no brainer for anyone and everyone wanting to break into hobby electronics of just about any flavor.</description>
