      <description>Anytone AT-D878UV A work horse dual-band handheld with enough analog and digital functionality to carry even advanced users for years and years.
Beginner Kit This kit is the one I purchased which includes a charging cradle, a programming cable, and access to the BridgeCom tutorial videos. I also purchased an extra battery and a lighter adapter charge cable. The price felt steep when I placed the order, but after a week of building a code plug and now a month of use, I am more than satisfied with my purchase.</description>

      <description>Baofeng UV-5R A cheap beginner dual-band handheld with enough features to be useful. Lots of extensive reviews exist, so Ill just touch on my limited use case.
This kit is the one I started with which includes a spare battery, whip antenna, programming cable, and &amp;ldquo;other stuff&amp;rdquo;. Good value for what is included.
Antennas and Accessories The stock UV-5R antenna is useable, but many options exist to support specific use cases.</description>
