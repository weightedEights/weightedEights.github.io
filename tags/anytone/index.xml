      <description>Anytone AT-D878UV A work horse dual-band handheld with enough analog and digital functionality to carry even advanced users for years and years.
Beginner Kit This kit is the one I purchased which includes a charging cradle, a programming cable, and access to the BridgeCom tutorial videos. I also purchased an extra battery and a lighter adapter charge cable. The price felt steep when I placed the order, but after a week of building a code plug and now a month of use, I am more than satisfied with my purchase.</description>
