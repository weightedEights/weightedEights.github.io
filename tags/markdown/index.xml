      <description>Preamble This site is a work in progress, a project as such. It has been enough of an effort for me that documenting the details is worthwhile for me, maybe for someone else too.
A statically-generated site allows all of your content to be created and maintained locally and allows you to control display elements with finer granularity.
All of my work and personal computing is and has been on Windows OS machines, for various reasons.</description>
